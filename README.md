# ADL-to-JSON-conversion-algorithm

This repository contains an algorithm that facilitates the conversion of openEHR Archetype Definition Language (ADL) files into valid JSON structures. The algorithm is designed to work with predefined parameters and is capable of including and converting new files into a comprehensive JSON structure. Each file in the designated folder represents a distinct section of the original ADL file, such as Concept, Header, Language, Ontology, Definition, and Description.

## Algorithm Overview
The openEHR ADL to JSON Converter Algorithm is a step-by-step process that ensures the accurate conversion of ADL files into JSON format while organizing them into a cohesive structure. The algorithm makes use of predefined functions to handle each section of the ADL file.

1. File Parsing and Function Calls
2. 
1.1. The algorithm begins by parsing the ADL files in the specified folder, extracting each section (Concept, Header, Language, Ontology, Definition, Description) individually.

1.2. For each section, a corresponding function is invoked to convert the extracted content into JSON format.

2. Individual Section Conversion
2.1. Concept Section
The createConcept function is responsible for converting the Concept section of the ADL file into JSON format. It handles concepts, terms, and mappings associated with the archetype.

2.2. Header Section
The createHeader function converts the Header section of the ADL file into JSON format. This section typically includes metadata about the archetype.

2.3. Language Section
The createLanguage function handles the conversion of the Language section, which includes translations of the archetype's text elements.

2.4. Ontology Section
The createOntology function is used to convert the Ontology section, which provides links to external terminologies and ontologies.

2.5. Definition Section
The createDefinition function converts the Definition section, which includes constraints and rules that define the archetype's structure.

2.6. Description Section
The createDescription function converts the Description section, providing human-readable explanations of the archetype's purpose.

3. Compilation of JSON Structure
The final step involves compiling the JSON structure by calling the respective functions for each section and organizing them into a cohesive JSON representation of the archetype. The resulting JSON structure provides a comprehensive representation of the ADL file.
